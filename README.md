## Get SmArt - A flashcard deck creator geared towards art history students and teachers.

I've taken a lot of art history exams in my life, for which I had to memorize a lot of information about images of famous works of art. My classmates and I would usually make our own flashcards in order to prepare for these tests, however it was sometimes unclear exactly what images we would need to memorize, and it was always a huge waste of paper.

I created GetSmArt to help art history instructors create more well-defined expectations for their students, and to make it easier and more fun for students to study for their upcoming exams! I'm still adding features and functionality to this, so as I update the app I will update here as well.

When you register, you will need to identify yourself as a student or instructor. In this video you can see what it looks like to sign in as an instructor who has already created a few galleries of images for their students.

For each class, an instructor can create any number of galleries. All of the images and information they enter into these galleries can be easily altered or removed.

A student's view of the galleries takes the form of a game. The descriptive fields need to be filled out correctly in order to score points. These points are saved so they can come back any time to try to beat their previous scores.
