This is a full-stack desktop application called GetSmart. 

When I was studying art history my classmates and I had to create our own art history flash cards. This was a frustrating process for a number of reasons, including the time it took, the lack of access to high quality images and/ or a printer, and the lack of clarity regarding which images we would be resonsible for memorizing.

GetSmArt allows art history instructors to create and share galleries of slides for specific classes and exams. The students are then able to play a game using those images where they get points for guessing the artist, title, year, and media.
